# Project Title

This project contains scripts for loading raster layers, creating grids, and performing zonal statistics in QGIS. The results are saved as CSV files.

## Usage

### Loading Raster Layers (LoadNC)

This script loads all `.nc` raster files from a specified directory into QGIS in reverse order.

### Creating Grid with Attributes (CreateGrid, AddLongAndLatToGrid)

This script creates a grid layer with longitude, latitude, and layer name attributes based on an existing grid layer.

### Grid Calculation to CSV (CutSeaLevelRaise)

This script performs zonal statistics on a grid layer and saves the results as CSV files. It also combines individual CSV files into a single output file.
